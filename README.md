Just stepped out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 The Ballad of Wallis Island, and wow, do I feel tangled up and a little bit upside down. And tired. Was it the   or the fact my phone keeps vibrating with junk mail? I can’t tell. But, let’s talk about it because I might explode otherwise.

First thing, Wallis Island itself. Man, they sure know how to make a hunk of rock seem like it’s got a pulse. It felt like the island was breathing. I’m half convinced I saw a tree wink at one point. Or maybe that was just the glare from the projector – who even owns a calibrated projector these days? Couldn’t they just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   like everyone else?

Anyway, those seagulls kept screaming on and on like a disapproving Greek chorus. Half the time I'm like, are these real birds or is it just the lead actor's soul trying to escape? Speaking of souls, if I had a nickel for every soul-searching face the lead actor made, I'd… I don't know, buy something classy like socks without holes.

> There was this one scene — let me remember — oh, yeah! When the main character just stands there trying to figure out if they want a sandwich or, I don't know, figure out the meaning of life? I felt that deep down. Why put cheese on existential crisis? Why not?

And oh, the soundtrack! Or should I call it the sound attack? Like, calm down, orchestra, the island's not going anywhere. But then the quieter moments hit, and suddenly, it's all this silence speaks volumes, like my toaster when it refuses to toast evenly.

Here's a quick line of code that popped into my head for no good reason during a pivotal moment with a sunset: 
```python
if ocean.is_sparkling():
    protagonist.emotion = confused_inspired
```

Did I love The Ballad of Wallis Island? Sometimes. Did it confuse me? Certainly! At the end of the day, it was messy, loud, quiet, overdone, yet undercooked — like entering a thrift store and coming out wearing a feather boa and a top hat, feeling slightly fabulous but mostly bewildered. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , don't 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it, either way, you’ll probably come out wondering if lobsters make good pets.
